#Code Book
This code book describes the variables, the data, and any works perfomed to get a tidy dataset.

#Identifiers
The identifiers for the output data set (tidy_data.txt) are the followings:
  -subject_id: The ID of test or train subjects
  -activity: The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

#Data and Units
The data in the output file (tidy_data.txt) contains 66 measurements of different movement signals as the followings. 
'-X or Y or Z' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. The 't' and 'f' indicate time and frequency domain signals. "mean()" indicates the mean value of each feature and std() indicates the stand deviation. 
The units for those variables with "Acc" (accelerometer) are gravity units "g", and for variables with "Gyro" (gyroscope) are radians/second.
